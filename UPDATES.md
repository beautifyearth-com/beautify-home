## 📧 Contact Form Analysis

### Current Status
The contact form uses Webflow's form handling which **will not work** outside of Webflow hosting.

### Recommended Solution: Netlify Forms

**Why Netlify Forms?**
- ✅ FREE (100 submissions/month)
- ✅ Zero backend code needed
- ✅ Built-in spam protection
- ✅ Email notifications
- ✅ Form submissions dashboard
- ✅ Works immediately when deployed to Netlify

**What needs to change:**
- Update form method from `GET` to `POST`
- Add `netlify` attribute to form tag
- Add hidden input for form name
- Keep existing reCAPTCHA (Netlify supports it)

### Alternative Solutions

See `CONTACT-FORM-SOLUTIONS.md` for complete comparison of:
1. **Netlify Forms** (Recommended - FREE)
2. **Formspree** ($0-10/month)
3. **EmailJS** ($0-7/month)
4. **Custom Backend** (integrate with your API)
