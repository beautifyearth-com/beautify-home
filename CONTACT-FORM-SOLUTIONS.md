## Implementation Steps

### Netlify Forms (Recommended for now)

I can update the contact form right now to work with Netlify Forms. Just say the word!

Changes needed:
1. Update `contact-us.html` form tag
2. Add hidden fields for Netlify
3. Keep existing reCAPTCHA (Netlify supports it)
4. Test after deploying to Netlify

### Custom Backend (For later)

If you want to integrate with your existing API:
1. Create endpoint: `POST /api/contact`
2. Accept form data
3. Send email notification
4. Return success/error response
5. Update form to use your endpoint
